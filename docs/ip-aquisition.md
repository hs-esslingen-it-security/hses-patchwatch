We identified stock market information as a useful source of company information. To be more efficient than scanning the complete Internet, we compiled a database from publicly available company data and map IP addresses to companies. 
This list of IP ranges is used as basis for our IP and port scans.

This list is generated as folows:
We join the ipinfo.io database "Company IP Address Database" with available Stock Data on Yahoo Finance.  
By doing so, we determine the corresponding IP Range for each listed company.
The IP addresses of these ranges are randomized and written to a list which is fed into the banner grabbing stage.
