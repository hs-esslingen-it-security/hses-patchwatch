In this last step, we compile a lookup table to decide which versions of the products that were revealed from the banners, are still maintained. This information is typically present on the vendor specific product page. After standard product support has ended, the vendor
may still offer security fixes for an additional fee. This means we essentially have four cases per product: (1) still maintained, (2) maintained in certain cases, (3) end-of-life, and (4) no information. Case (4) represents all banners that revealed the product but not the version.
